# FNB58 current graph

How flashmon graphs live current draw from a FNIRSI FNB58/FNB48 USB power meter
while the serial monitor runs. This is the reference behind the FNB58 code in
[`../flashmon/flashmon.js`](../flashmon/flashmon.js) (search `FNB58`) and its
markup/styles in [`index.html`](../flashmon/index.html). It rides WebHID.

The meter is a USB **HID** device, not a serial port, so it opens over
**WebHID** in the same tab as the device's Web Serial monitor. The two live
side by side: the graph panel pins across the top of the monitor and the
terminal slides down to clear it.

## The HID stream

On open we kick the vendor stream with three 64-byte reports (`0xaa`, a type
byte, 61 zeros, a trailing checksum): `0x81`/`0x8e`, then `0x82`/`0x96` twice.
Some units auto-stream; for the rest a 1 Hz keep-alive (`0x83`/`0x9e`) holds it
open. There is **no stop command** — a session ends by ceasing the keep-alive and
draining the endpoint before closing (see [Connecting](#connecting-draining-the-fifo-and-a-settle-cooldown),
which is where the meter's touchiness about session end lives).

Each input report is 64 bytes (report id stripped) and carries **four 15-byte
samples**. A report is ours when byte 0 is `0xaa` and byte 1 is `0x04`. Within a
sample, voltage is a little-endian `u32` at offset 0 and **current a
little-endian `u32` at offset +4**, both `/100000` to reach volts/amps; we keep
current only, as **mA** (`raw / 100`). That raw `u32` is in units of `1e-5 A`, so
the meter's current resolution is **0.01 mA** — we store it as a float (never
rounded to a whole mA), and the readouts below 20 mA show **one decimal**
(`fnbFmtMa`) so that sub-mA detail is visible at low draw; at 20 mA and up they
round to a whole number. The meter streams at roughly **100 Hz** (four samples
per ~40 ms report), but nothing downstream trusts that rate — see timestamps
below.

## Background tabs: every FNB58 timer lives in flashmon's worker

A hidden tab clamps window timers to one per second, and after five minutes
hidden to roughly one per minute. Input reports are unaffected — they keep
arriving — but everything that *drives* the session is a timer: the 1 Hz
keep-alive that holds the stream open, the stall watchdog riding the same tick,
and the short sleeps in the open/recover/drain paths. Left on window timers, a
backgrounded tab stops feeding the meter, the meter stops streaming, and the
watchdog then tears the session down: switching tabs would drop the graph.

So the FNB58 shares the worker flashmon already uses for un-throttled timers
(`wtSpawn`, the same one that keeps a flash from crawling in a hidden tab):

- The keep-alive/watchdog tick is `wtSetInterval(fnbTick, 1000)` — a
  self-re-arming chain of worker timeouts, so a slow tick can't stack behind
  itself. `fnb.stopTick` cancels it; `fnbUnbind`/`fnbTeardown` call that instead
  of `clearInterval`.
- The 5 s `fnbPollStatus` runs on the same helper, so the shared active stamp
  stays fresh while this tab streams — a throttled poll would let the stamp go
  stale and another tab would read that as an idle meter and take it.
- `fnbTryDevice`, `fnbAutoRecover` and the `FNB58_DRAIN_MS` drain hold
  `useWorkerTimers()` for their duration, so their `sleep()`s keep real time.

Only the graph is left to the tab: `requestAnimationFrame` pauses while hidden,
the ring keeps filling from the reports, and the first visible frame draws the
history that accumulated meanwhile.

## Storage: a timestamped ring, 5 minutes

Readings land in two parallel rings, `fnb.ma` (mA, `Float32`) and `fnb.ts`
(arrival time in ms from `performance.now()`, `Float64`), sized for **5 minutes**
at the nominal 100 Hz (`FNB58_CAP = 100 * 300`). All four readings in a report
share one arrival stamp — they fall inside the same ~10 ms and the draw-time
averaging resolves them.

Storing a **timestamp per sample**, rather than assuming a fixed rate and
indexing by sample count, is what makes the display honest and smooth: the graph
is drawn against real elapsed time, so a slow or bursty stream doesn't stretch or
shimmer the history.

## Display window: pills, with an auto default

A row of pills above the graph selects the visible span: **10s, 30s, 1m, 3m,
5m** (`FNB58_WINDOWS`, seconds). Selection has two modes:

- **Auto** (default, `fnb.winSel == null`): the window is the *smallest span that
  still holds every stored sample* — `FNB58_WINDOWS.find(w => bufferSpan <= w)`.
  So the graph opens at 10s and steps up to 30s, 1m, … only as history
  accumulates past each threshold. The auto-picked pill is highlighted with a
  **dashed** border to signal it will move on its own.
- **Pinned**: clicking a pill fixes that span (solid highlight). Clicking the
  pinned pill again hands the window back to auto.

**Clearing resets to auto.** The average box (left) clears the whole buffer and
restarts — `fnb.len` drops to 0 and `fnb.winSel` returns to `null` — so an empty
buffer auto-selects 10s again. The average box shows the mean over the whole
stored buffer and the span it currently covers (`last <n> s`), capped at 5 min.

## Drawing: one averaged, interpolated column per pixel

The naive graph — fold the ring into pixel columns and take the **max** per
column — is wrong two ways: many samples share a pixel so a single spike makes
the whole column read too high, and folding by sample index makes columns
reshuffle as the ring shifts, so the graph **shimmers** as it scrolls.

Instead, each frame builds a per-pixel table keyed by **time**:

1. The right edge is the newest sample's timestamp `tEnd`; the left edge is
   `tEnd − window`. Each of the `cols` pixel columns owns a `dt = window / cols`
   wide time slice.
2. One pass over the buffer buckets every reading whose timestamp lands in the
   window into its column, accumulating **sum and count**. (The same pass sums the
   whole buffer for the average box.)
3. Each column's value is its **mean** (`sum / count`) — averaging, not max, so a
   lone spike is diluted by the ~20 neighbours sharing its 200 ms-wide pixel at
   the 10s window rather than inflating it.
4. Columns with no sample are **NaN** and get **linearly interpolated** from their
   nearest filled neighbours on each side. Only *interior* gaps are filled; the
   empty run to the **left of the oldest sample stays blank**, so the graph fills
   from the right instead of stretching a thin history across the whole width.

Bars are drawn from the averaged/interpolated values, scaled to a "nice" max
rounded up to the next 10 mA. The **peak pill** is taken from the *averaged*
columns too (not raw samples), placed against its column and flipped left only
when it would overflow the right edge. The live **now** readout in the top bar is
the newest raw sample.

Because the table is rebuilt against `tEnd` every frame, the same wall-clock
instant maps to the same column from frame to frame — that time-anchoring, plus
per-pixel averaging, is what removes the shimmer.

## Time axis

A row under the graph shows five evenly spaced labels from the left edge to
`now` at the right, formatted relative: `now`, `−45s`, or `−3:20` past a minute
(`fnbFmtAgo`). They track the active window, so pinning a wider span relabels the
axis.

## Device match

WebHID filters on vendor id `0x2e3c` (FNIRSI) or `0x0483` (ST, used by some
units). Unplugging the meter tears the graph down via the WebHID `disconnect`
event.

## Connecting: draining the FIFO, and a settle cooldown

The single fact that governs everything here — and a **documented FNIRSI quirk**
(see baryluk's and didim99's loggers): **these meters have no stop command, and
they freeze if you close the connection while their internal FIFO still has data.**
Closing our USB handle doesn't stop the meter; it keeps streaming into its FIFO,
and an abrupt close leaves that buffer full, wedging the meter — which is what
crashes the *next* session. Because the freeze is in the meter's USB stack, it
survives a Chrome restart and an FNB power-cycle; only a replug (or a long wait)
clears it. baryluk's fix, which we mirror: **drain before closing.**

**Drain on disconnect.** `fnbTeardown` stops the keepalive first, then keeps the
device **open** for `FNB58_DRAIN_MS` (1 s) with the report handler still attached,
so the browser keeps reading the endpoint and empties the meter's FIFO; only then
does it `close()` and drop the grant. No full buffer at close → no freeze. (This
is the primary cure;
everything below is backup, since the drain is only *mostly* reliable — the same
loggers note the meter still occasionally sticks, and then a replug is the answer,
which `fnbShowTrouble` tells the user.)

**Settle cooldown, via one shared LocalSettings timestamp.**
`flashmon.fnb58LastData` holds the epoch-ms the meter was last active
(`fnbMarkActive`): refreshed every 5 s while streaming (`fnbPollStatus`) and stamped
again at disconnect (`fnbTeardown`), so a short `FNB58_COOLDOWN_MS` (3 s) settle
runs from the last activity. While that stamp is younger than the cooldown
(`fnbCoolingDown`), `fnbConnect` refuses to open and the FNB58 **label is hidden**
(`fnbPollStatus` drops the button immediately on disconnect and re-checks every 5 s,
so it returns once the meter has settled). That one shared stamp also keeps two tabs
off the meter at once: while any tab streams it stays fresh, so other tabs' labels
stay hidden; after a disconnect the cooldown applies to all tabs equally, and
whoever clicks first once it clears becomes the next owner. No cross-tab messaging,
no ownership tokens — just the timestamp.

**Every open is clean, every close awaited.** `fnbUnbind` awaits `device.close()`
(an un-awaited close leaves a handle half-open for the next `open()` to trip on),
`fnbBind` closes any handle this tab still holds before opening, and `fnbConnect`
runs `fnbCloseGranted` first. Disconnect→reconnect is serialized by an
`fnb.stopping` guard (the button awaits `stopFnb58`).

**Listen before init.** Even post-cooldown, `fnbBind` listens for `FNB58_PROBE_MS`
(400 ms) after opening and sends the start sequence **only if the meter is silent**
(`allowInit` + no data yet). A unit that happens to still be streaming is latched
onto without a re-init; only a genuinely idle meter is kicked.

**A grant is never reused — every connect goes through the chooser.** A remembered
grant is a handle onto a meter whose state we know nothing about: it may be
mid-stream from another tab, or wedged from a session that ended badly, and
opening it silently is how a session starts against a frozen unit. So a grant
lives exactly as long as the session that asked for it. `fnbForget(device)` closes
the handle and calls `device.forget()`, so `navigator.hid.getDevices()` stops
returning it; `fnbForgetGranted()` sweeps every FNB58 grant this tab still holds.
It runs in three places: on **load** (anything a prior session or a crash left
behind), before every **connect**, and at **teardown** — including the
`pagehide`/`beforeunload` cleanup, whose async `forget()` the unload may cut
short, which is what the boot sweep is there to finish.

**Connect = chooser → power-cycle** (`fnbConnect`, only ever from the label click;
nothing runs on load):

1. **Revoke any leftover grant** (`fnbForgetGranted`), then **ask for the HID
   device** (`requestDevice`) — the label click carries the user gesture WebHID's
   chooser requires. The picked device gets generous retries
   (`fnbTryDevice(device, 3)`), each waiting up to `FNB58_DATA_WAIT_MS` (1.5 s) for
   a **valid report**, since *opened* is not *working* (`fnbAwaitData` is the proof).
2. **Give up with a power-cycle hint.** If it yields no data, a dialog tells the
   user to unplug/replug the FNB58 (`fnbShowTrouble`).

**Losing data mid-stream.** A 1 Hz watchdog (`fnbTick`) notices when no valid report
has arrived for `FNB58_LOSS_MS` (3 s) and runs `fnbAutoRecover`: it closes our own
handle and makes **one** clean recycle attempt with `allowInit=false` — re-latching
a stream that's merely still running, never re-initing a meter that has actually
stopped. If nothing comes back it disconnects for real (`fnbTeardown`), and the
cooldown then holds the reopen off until the meter has idled.

## Not the device's serial port

The FNB58 is a **composite** USB device: alongside the HID interface it exposes a
CDC **serial port**, which appears in the Web Serial chooser right next to the
board. Picking it as "the device" opens a dead monitor — there's no ESP to probe,
so `probeChip()` returns null and you land in a bare terminal with only a Reset
button (no Flash / Open-UI), and a replug can't reopen the meter's CDC cleanly
(`-- serial port came back but reopen failed --`).

`isFnb58Port(port)` guards against this, matching `port.getInfo().usbVendorId`
against the same vendor ids as the HID picker (`0x2e3c` / `0x0483`):

`connect()` rejects a chosen FNB58 serial port up front with a hint to pick the
device's port instead, rather than opening the dead monitor.

The graph only ever reaches the meter over WebHID (the FNB58 button); the meter's
serial port is never the right pick here. (A genuinely non-ESP board still gets the
normal "No ESP32 detected" plain terminal — only the FNB58's own port is special-cased.)
