// flashmon — browser firmware flashing / serial monitor.
//
// Connecting only opens the port: the device is not touched, not reset, and the
// monitor shows whatever it is already doing. It is then ASKED which board it
// is — `show sys.hw`, one frame on the already-open port. spangap confirms the
// board its image was built for against the hardware at every boot and halts on
// a mismatch, so a device that answers has already settled the question and
// nothing needs resetting.
//
// Only a device with no answer — no firmware, an image too old to carry the key,
// a generic image, or one that does not speak frames — is worth a probe: reset
// the chip, RAM-load the peripheral detector (no flash write), and read the
// board off the buses. That run is "Detect hardware" in the settings panel, and
// it is also what a connect falls back to unless "No reset" says to leave the
// device alone.
//
// That probe assumes a reset it can drive, and not every board has one: a device
// whose USB is on the S3's USB-OTG controller rather than USB-Serial-JTAG has
// neither DTR/RTS nor the Serial-JTAG reset sequence, so esptool's reset runs and
// nothing happens. Reaching the ROM loader there takes a human holding BOOT and
// tapping RESET. So a silent device is asked a second question before the probe:
// is it in the loader ALREADY? If it is, the whole run switches to no-reset —
// probe, detector upload and flash alike — because a reset it cannot perform is
// also a state it cannot get back. The RAM detector closes the circle by
// returning to the loader instead of idling, so the flash that follows still
// finds the ROM up without anyone touching the board again. Starting the
// firmware at the end needs no hands either: a reset does not have to come from
// outside the chip, and arming the RTC watchdog from the loader restarts it —
// which is what esptool falls back to on this chip for the same reason.
//
// Once the board is known and the catalogue holds an image for it, the offer
// appears in that same device window, under the facts it follows from: "Flash"
// for an image newer than what runs, "Flash anyway" — behind a warning — for an
// older one, and nothing for the build it already runs. Going
// ahead unzips that image in the browser and flashes every segment at its offset
// over Web Serial (vendored esptool-js), then drops back into the monitor and
// resets the device so its boot log streams live. With auto-flash on, a newer
// image doesn't wait to be asked about.
//
// The catalogues are directories beside this page — ../builds/<catalogue>/ —
// and ../builds/index.html lists them. Which one is in force starts at `stable`,
// is overridden by `?build=`, follows the attached device's own
// `build: catalogue` line, and is finally the user's to pick in the settings
// panel. Three files in a catalogue drive everything:
//
//   builds.yaml   the brand and the entries (each `name` matched against the
//                 detected hw-<board>)
//   index.html    the images that exist, as <slug>_<name>_<stamp>.zip links;
//                 the newest stamp for a board is the offer
//   timestamp     the newest stamp in the directory, polled so a build
//                 published while the page is open is noticed
//
// No CDN, no build step — these files can be served from anywhere static.

// VID is a USB-UART bridge, which resets over DTR/RTS. An Espressif VID with any
// other PID is the OTG path — the chip's own ROM device, whose PID is its chip
// id — and there is nothing to pulse.

// written against the Web Serial shape — requestPort, a port with readable /
// writable / setSignals, connect and disconnect events — and never learns which
// one is underneath.
//
// Web Serial (navigator.serial) is the desktop one. It is also the only one
// that reaches a board through a USB-to-serial bridge chip, because a bridge
// speaks a vendor protocol that the operating system's driver knows and a web
// page does not.
//
// WebUSB (navigator.usb) hands a page raw endpoints instead, so a page can
// itself drive a port that is standard USB CDC-ACM (Communications Device
// Class, Abstract Control Model). That is exactly what an ESP32 with native USB
// presents, on the USB-Serial-JTAG controller and on the firmware's own CDC
// ports alike. web-serial-polyfill builds the Web Serial shape out of those
// endpoints, and the adapter below completes it.
//
// Android is the whole reason for the choice. Chrome there does expose
// navigator.serial, but it enumerates Bluetooth serial ports only: the chooser
// opens on a phone with a board plugged into it and lists nothing, and no
// amount of retrying changes that. WebUSB is what Android implements for a USB
// peripheral, so that is the road taken there — at the cost of the bridge-chip
// boards, which no page can drive over raw endpoints.

// input report carries four 15-byte samples (voltage u32 LE, current u32 LE,
// /100000 → volts/amps). At ~100 samples/s we ring-buffer each reading with its
// arrival timestamp (up to 5 minutes) and paint a scrolling bar graph across the
// top of the monitor.
//
// The session outlives a hidden tab. Input reports keep arriving unthrottled, but
// the 1 Hz keep-alive is what holds the stream open and the same 1 Hz tick is the
// stall watchdog — on window timers a background tab would clamp both to a minute,
// the meter would stop streaming and the watchdog would then tear the session down.
// So every FNB58 timer runs on flashmon's worker timers (wtSetInterval, and
// useWorkerTimers around the sleeping open/recover/drain paths). Only the graph is

// that can see the device. So the tab lends it the console. The server it talks
// to is the hub — what the tabs attach to, and what routes between them and the
// container's own `spangap log` / `spangap cli`.
//
//   tab -> hub   {"t":"hello","node":"f9fb74","host":"tbeam","fw":…,"hw":…}

// channel the setup probes use, so it neither shows in the terminal nor
// disturbs what is streaming through it.

// once, over the same framed channel the setup commands go out on, and only
// after the questions that DO have boot lines are settled.
//
// `show <key>` answers each one: it prints `<key> = <value>` when the key is
// there and the literal `(no matches)` when it isn't. That is the whole
// protocol — an absent straddle, an absent key and an unset value are all
// distinguishable without any new firmware verb.
//
// ONE KEY PER QUERY, never a subtree. A reply frame is length-counted and the
// device's log echo goes to the same wire on its own path, so a log line that
// lands inside a frame is unrecoverable for this side — and the wider the frame,
// the wider that window. Asking `show s.lora.0` during the boot storm (wifi
// associating, ntp, webrtc, the mesh coming up) put a ~25-line reply in the
// middle of it and lost frames, which surface as `SG` + the frame's id printed
// into the terminal. Each of these replies is one short line.
//
// Firmware that doesn't speak frames is left alone: we cannot ask, so we don't
// guess, and neither dialog opens.

// that setup's own init, so the key exists in a build that has it and nowhere
// else — the same "a key that is there is the capability" reading the extras

// a mismatch is closed again, untouched beyond the one carriage return — which
// a spangap console answers and ignores, and which is the only thing ever

// — not the negotiation below — is what makes a steal impossible.
